# About this project
The objective of this project is to detect a drone in any house or private property. As long as the device is installed in the desired area, an alert will be sent to the proprietor's mobile phone when a drone is hovering over the area. The main problem regarding the drones is the fact that it is only strictly illegal for them to fly over airports and military bases, but legal for them to invade a person's property whether it’s being used for recreational or malicious purposes. With the drone detector the proprietor can be out of town and receive an alert to take safe actions as calling the police if desired.
